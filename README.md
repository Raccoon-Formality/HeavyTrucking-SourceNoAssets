# HeavyTrucking-SourceNoAssets
The source code for my game Heavy Trucking with no assets. I am uploading this promote learning.

This is just the code with no assets. If you would like to have the full source code with assets, please buy my game on itch.io and it will come with a download to a copy of the full source code.

If you do purchase the source code and play with it, be sure to change the pdxinfo file to not be the original game's stuff. This can cause version conflicts on the device.
